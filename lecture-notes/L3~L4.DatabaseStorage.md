# Lecture 3. Database Storage 1

## Storage System

1. Disk-Based
   
   The DBMS assumes that the primary storage location of the database is on non-volatile disk.
The DBMS's components manage the movement of data between non-volatile and volatile storage.

2. Sequentail Access

    Random access on non-volatile storage is almost always much slower than sequential access.
DBMS will want to maximize sequential access.
- Algorithms try to reduce number of writes to random
pages so that data is stored in contiguous blocks.
- Allocating multiple pages at the same time is called an
extent.

3. Why not use the OS?

    OS cannot know better than dbms.

    Problem #1: Transaction Safety

    → OS can flush dirty pages at any time.

    Problem #2: I/O Stalls

    → DBMS doesn't know which pages are in memory. The OS will stall a thread on page fault.

    Problem #3: Error Handling

    → Difficult to validate pages. Any access can cause a `SIGBUS` that the DBMS must handle.

    Problem #4: Performance Issues

    → OS data structure contention. TLB shootdowns. 

    Some dbms (monet db, IMDB, Raven db, level db, elasticsearch, quest db) uses `mmap` with `madvise`, `mlock`, `msync`.

    - `madvise`: Tell the OS how you expect to read certain pages.
    - `mlock`: Tell the OS that memory ranges cannot be paged out.
    - `msync`: Tell the OS to flush memory ranges out to disk.


## Main Topics About Database Storage

#### 1. How the DBMS represents the database in files on disk

#### 2. How the DBMS manages its memory and moves data back and forth from disk

## File Storage

The DBMS stores a database as one or more files on disk typically in a proprietary format. The OS doesn't know anything about the contents of these files. The `storage manager` is responsible for maintaining a database's files. Some do their own scheduling for reads and writes to improve spatial and temporal locality of pages. It organizes the files as a collection of `pages`.

A `page` is a fixed-size block of data. It can contain tuples, meta-data, indexes, log records, ... etc. Most systems do not mix page types. Each page is given a unique identifier. The DBMS uses an indirection layer to map page IDs to physical locations.

There are three different notions of `"pages"` in a DBMS:

→ Hardware Page (usually 4KB)

→ OS Page (usually 4KB)

→ Database Page (512B-16KB)

Different DBMSs manage pages in files on disk in different ways.

- Heap File Organization
- Tree File Organization
- Sequential / Sorted File Organization (ISAM)
- Hashing File Organization

### Heap File

A heap file is an unordered collection of pages with tuples that are stored in random order. Also supports iterating over all pages. Need meta-data to keep track of what pages exist in multiple files and which ones have free space.

The DBMS maintains special pages that tracks the location of data pages in the database files: `page directory`.Must make sure that the directory pages are in sync with the data pages. The directory also records meta-data about available space. (The number of free slots per page, List of free / empty pages)

## Page Layout

Every page contains a header of metadata about the page's contents.

- Page Size
- Checksum
- DBMS Version
- Transaction Visibility
- Compression Information

Some systems require pages to be selfcontained (e.g., Oracle), which means header has table that the page came from, schema, column, etc. That means, even if some table's metadata information is lost, dbms can restore using some data's header.

For any page storage architecture, we now need to decide how to organize the data inside of the page. We are still assuming that we are only storing tuples.

Two approaches:

- tuple oriented
- log structured


## Tuple Storage

A strawman approach to laying out data is to keep track of how many tuples the DBMS has stored in a page and then append to the end every time a new tuple is added. However, problems arise when tuples are deleted or when tuples have variable-length attributes.

=> Slotted Pages: Page maps slots to offsets.

The slot array maps "slots"(fixed length) to the tuples'(var length) starting position offsets. To add a tuple, the slot array will grow from the beginning to the end, and the data of the tuples will grow from end to the beginning. The page is considered full when the slot array and the tuple data meet.

The header keeps track of the number of used slots, the offset of the starting location of the last slow used. When compaction arise (for example, deleted Tuple #3), it will just slide data. (for example, Tuple #4's start location goes to Tuple #3's start location).

The DBMS needs a way to keep track of individual tuples. Each tuple is assigned a unique record identifier. (commonly, `page_id` + `offset/slot`)

PostgreSQL: CTID (6 bytes)

SQLite: ROWID (8 bytes)

ORACLE: ROWID (10 bytes)


#### Denormalized Tuple Data
If two tables are related(foreign key), the DBMS can “pre-join” them, so the tables end up on the same page. This makes reads faster since the DBMS only has to load in one page rather than two separate pages. However, it makes updates more expensive since the DBMS needs more space for each tuple.
